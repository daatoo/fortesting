Advanced Request Capabilities
-----------------------------

### Flexible Metric Selection

Choose exactly the metrics you need - from a single data point to comprehensive multi-metric analysis in one request.

<Callout attributes='{"isFitToPage":false,"dataType":"error","style":{"width":"60%","minWidth":"60%"}}'>
<strong class="slate-bold">Previous versions</strong>
<span style="color:var(--dark-notification-danger-box-content)">Single metric per request → Multiple API calls required</span>
</Callout>

<Callout attributes='{"isFitToPage":false,"dataType":"success","style":{"width":"60%","minWidth":"60%"}}'>
<strong class="slate-bold">API V5</strong>
<span style="color:var(--dark-notification-success-box-content)">Multiple metrics per request → Unified, efficient data retrieval</span>
</Callout>

**What does it mean for you:**

*   **Reduced API Calls:** Get related metrics in single requests
    
*   **Faster Dashboards**: Build comprehensive views with fewer API calls.
    

### Single API Key (Batch and REST)

Unlike in V4, where separate keys were required for REST and Batch endpoints, you can now pull data from any endpoint using a single key

Unified API Standards
---------------------

Consistent behavior across all endpoints - V5 standardizes response formats, error handling, and request patterns across every endpoint. This means once you learn one endpoint, you understand them all.
